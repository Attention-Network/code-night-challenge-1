# code-night-challenge-1
Sunday Code Night Challenge is where every Sunday participants can gather in the studio to work on small coding projects, explore new technologies, or collaborate on quick builds while enjoying some craft coffee or tea. The core outcome is to build something useful within 6 hours along a challenge theme.

Here’s how it will work:

1. Challenge Themes: Each session has a unique theme, like building a small web app, automating a task, or exploring a specific programming language.
2. Time Boxed: Participants have 2-3 hours to build something functional, with the pressure off on making it perfect—it’s all about creativity and collaboration.
3. Show & Tell: At the end of the session, everyone shares what they’ve built. It’s not about the most polished project, but about learning and experimenting together.
4. Support & Share: Experienced coders can offer mini-workshops or pair up with beginners to share knowledge.
5. Recognition: Highlight particularly interesting or innovative projects in your community newsletter or social media, keeping the vibe fun and supportive.

It’s a casual, low-pressure way to keep people engaged with coding and tech, encouraging both beginners and experienced coders to participate.

Price: The first Code Night Challenge is free.

Duration: 6pm till midnight

Studio experience:

1. Unlimited black coffee
2. Table tennis, carom in breaks
3. Night mode lighting
4. Music requests

## Code Night Challenge 1

“Automating Your Workflow: Build a Simple Task Automation Script”

Concept:
In this session, you’ll have the opportunity to create simple Python scripts that automate everyday tasks. Whether it’s organizing your files, sending reminder emails, scraping data from websites, or generating reports, the focus will be on practical and accessible projects. By the end of the night, you’ll walk away with a tool that streamlines your daily routine, making your life easier and more efficient.

Event Guidelines

1.	Setting Up the Environment:
•	Ensure you have a Python development environment ready (e.g., Anaconda, Google Colab, or a local IDE).
•	Install necessary libraries, such as os, smtplib, requests, or any other tools you may need for your script.
•	Prepare a basic project structure to keep your files organized.
2.	Success Criteria:
•	Functionality: Your script should successfully automate the chosen task with minimal manual input.
•	Efficiency: The automation should be time-saving and operate smoothly without unnecessary resource consumption.
•	Usability: The script should be easy to use and, if applicable, include simple instructions or a user interface.
•	Originality: Creative approaches and unique task selections will be valued.
•	Documentation: Provide brief documentation that explains what your script does, how to set it up, and how to use it. Essentially, write a Readme for your Github project.
3.	Timeline:
•	You’ll have 4 hours to complete your automation project.
•	Make sure to allocate time for testing, debugging, and final touch-ups.

Rewards

•	Best Overall Automation Script: Awarded to the participant whose script excels in functionality, efficiency, and usability.
•	Most Creative Solution: For the most innovative and original approach to task automation.
•	Best Documentation: For the script that comes with the clearest and most helpful documentation.
