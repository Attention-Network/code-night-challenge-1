# code-night-challenge-1
Sunday Code Night Challenge is where every Sunday participants can gather in the studio to work on small coding projects, explore new technologies, or collaborate on quick builds while enjoying some craft coffee or tea. The core outcome is to build something useful within 6 hours along a challenge theme.
